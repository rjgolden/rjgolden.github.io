Website to host the test of openstreetmaps and leaflet on flutterflow. Embed this link (rjgolden.github.io) into the 'webView' widget in flutter flow to see the map working in the app.
-Currently unsure of how to make flutterflow UI interact with the website itself. ***This might not be the final version because of this***
